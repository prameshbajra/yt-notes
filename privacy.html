                    The policy is intended to satisfy Chrome Web Store disclosure requirements and reassure end users that their notes remain private.

                            This policy governs information collected, stored, or otherwise processed by the Video Notes Chrome extension.
                            The extension operates solely within your browser to augment youtube.com/watch pages and does not rely on external infrastructure.
                            For the purpose of applicable privacy regulations, the data controller is Pramesh Bajracharya

                        <p>
                            Video Notes is designed to function without gathering personal data or transmitting content away from the device.
                            The extension processes only the information required to save and surface your notes:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The free-form text you enter into the Video Notes workspace.</li>
                            <li>Timestamps associated with the active YouTube video in order to place markers on the timeline.</li>
                            <li>The YouTube video identifier, title, and locally calculated note counts to organize entries.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The extension does not request or infer usernames, email addresses, browsing history, or analytics identifiers.

                        <p>
                            All information described above remains on the device within <code>chrome.storage.local</code>
                            under the keys <code>videoNotes:notes</code> and <code>videoNotes:metadata</code>.
                            Chrome synchronizes nothing from these keys to Google servers, and no remote databases are used.

                        <p>
                            Data persists until you delete it through the extension, clear browser storage, or uninstall the extension.
                            No automated retention policies, analytics, or log files are created outside of Chrome's own diagnostics.

                        <p>
                            Video Notes requests the minimum set of permissions needed to operate:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>storage</strong> &mdash; allows the extension to store the notes you create in <code>chrome.storage.local</code>.</li>
                            <li><strong>activeTab</strong> &mdash; enables the popup to access metadata about the currently focused YouTube tab so it can load relevant notes.</li>
                            <li><strong>scripting</strong> &mdash; injects the content script that renders the inline workspace on youtube.com/watch pages.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            These permissions do not provide the extension with the ability to read data on non-YouTube sites, collect browsing history, or transmit any note content beyond your browser.

                        <p>
                            The extension does not initiate outbound network requests other than what is necessary for YouTube to play video content in your tab.
                            No analytics SDKs, advertising services, or third-party processors are bundled with the codebase.
                            Consequently, Video Notes does not sell, trade, or disclose your information to anyone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If future versions introduce optional features that rely on a network service, those changes will be documented,
                            made opt-in, and reflected in an updated version of this policy.

                        <p>
                            Because data never leaves your browser, security focuses on minimizing attack surface:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The extension injects lightweight, auditable scripts based on open-source code published at <a href="https://github.com/prameshbajra/yt-notes" rel="noreferrer noopener">github.com/prameshbajra/yt-notes</a>.</li>
                            <li>No remote code execution, evaluation of third-party scripts, or dynamic module loading occurs at runtime.</li>
                            <li>Patches are distributed through the Chrome Web Store update channel to ensure authenticity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Users remain responsible for protecting their own devices with appropriate operating-system level safeguards.

                            You are fully in control of the content stored by Video Notes. Available controls include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using the export option in the popup dashboard to download a JSON backup of all notes.</li>
                            <li>Importing a trusted backup file to restore data on a different profile or machine.</li>
                            <li>Deleting individual notes or clearing all data through Chrome's site settings or by uninstalling the extension.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Because the extension does not maintain server-side records, formal data access or deletion requests beyond your browser are unnecessary—the data resides solely with you.
